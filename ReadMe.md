# What is Vis-Trec?
<p>
Vis-Trec, Visualization tool as the extension of Trec_eval tool to facilitate researchers in the IR task evaluation and visualization step.
This software is developed to help researchers to have a better visualization  of Trec_eval resutls.With this software you can easily evaluate your ad hoc retrieval results for any Collection. 
In general Vis-Trec conducts 4 types of analysis and visualizations the analysis in order to avoid time-consuming repetitive task in IR domain for researchers. Plot type 1 i.e, Help-Hurt visualization of the analysis over baseline’s ranked and query percentiles for both ALL queries and defined Hard queries and plot type 2  i.e  visualization of the analysis over baseline’s ranked query percentiles for both ALL and HARD queries . Mor over, considering the user’s selected metric of measurement, the measured values for each retrieval gets inserted in a Latex table which code can easily get generated and printed within a text file in the specified directory by Vis-Trec.
